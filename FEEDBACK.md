### 5. Final Feedback

<hr>

<p>
Nice work on the app man. I think if you're able to perform some kind of CRUD operation on the MERN stack is a win, especially considering how fast paced those last three weeks were. There were some place's where the app could have been better, for example more flushed out operations to provide a flawless user experience. Other wise I thought you did a great job overall. Keep up the journey, and never stop learning
